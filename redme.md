## üìù Project Overview

Losing personal belongings is a common problem on university campuses and other public spaces. Traditional lost-and-found systems are often manual, inefficient, and prone to mismanagement.

The **Campus Lost and Found Management System** is a **web-based application** that allows students, staff, and visitors to:

- Report lost or found items
- Search and browse listings
- Submit verified claims

An **admin dashboard** ensures oversight by managing items and verifying claims, improving recovery rates and creating a secure campus environment.
